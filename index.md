  - The Smoky Mountain jazz jam aims to provide a space for jazz musicians in Western North Carolina to get together and play. 
  - The jam focuses on playing jazz repertoire from the Great American Songbook and from jazz composers.
  - We hope it will be of interest to amateur (or pro) jazz musicians in Western North Carolina, particularly those living in Haywood and Jackson counties.
